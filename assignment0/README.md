### Five topics I enjoy related to computing, in no specific order:
1. Game design --
     
     I really like game design on both a creative and technical level. Designing and implementing a system's logic is enjoyable, and it only gets better when it serves the purpose of storytelling. 

2. Interaction design --

    This is loosely related to computing, and more of a design subject, but a big reason of why I got invested in programming and computer science. It can sound a little corporate, but I find consideration for how a user will interact with my software key to its functionality.

3. Artificial intelligence --

    I'm really intimidated by AI and its rising prominence. I have some ethical concerns for this field, namely around the developers and companies and the power they have. I think there's a lot of interesting potential though, and I'm interested in the lighthearted uses of AI.

4. Web design --

    I think this topic and interest is fairly similar to game and interaction design. I value web design because it is a fun opportunity to present something meaningful, and organize information as thoughtfully and intuitively as possible.

5. Documentation --

    I don't know if this is a great topic for this list. However, I really enjoy the documenting my programs, and I think there's something special about good documentation. The communication and understanding that documentation forms between developers is sometimes understated.

### Five topics that are difficult right now, in no specific order:
1. Web design --

    I'm familiar with the basics of HTML/CSS and JavaScript, however I don't have enough practice to complete some advanced projects I've conceptualized. I think that my weakness here lies in not having the experience with JavaScript, and an underdeveloped understanding of responsive web design.

2. Cybersecurity --

    I don't think I understand the basics of cybersecurity. I would like to, as it's only becoming more and more important in the world, and I think it's a topic that could click with me.

3. Artificial intelligence --

    I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to AI. I understand neural networks on a conceptual level, but I've never implemented one. Philosophically I find the concept of a machine mimicking emotion to be fascinating.

4. Game design --

    Beyond simple games (text adventures, visual novels, a Tamagotchi-esque pet simulators), I don't know where to begin with actually building a video game. I have used Unity before, and I can determine the flow and logic of games I would like to build, but I lack the experience and sustainable approach.

5. C++ --

    I have basic experience with C++, namely experience that prepares me for the syntax and style of the language. Coming from Python, I'm struggling a little, namely with arrays and any other "list-like" data type. Learning more about how C++ works internally is gradually helping me to adjust my approach.
