# CS260 Assignment 2: Designing a List Data Structure

### Guidelines
> Based on what we know about linked lists, design a list data structure that allows us to add (insert) or remove (delete) values at a given location in the list (instead of the top of a stack or the front or back of a queue):
> 
> What functions are we likely to need for a list to function like this?
> 
> What values will we need to know about the structure for our list to function properly?

### Initial notes
1. `.insert()` to insert something at a specific location; `.remove()` to remove from a specific location. `.take()`, or a better name, to remove and return something from a given space on the list? `.length()` is always nice.

2. order of items
