# CS260 Assignment 2: Designing a Queue Data Structure

### Guidelines
> Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure:
> 
> What functions are we likely to need for a queue to function like the one discussed in class?
> 
> What values will we need to know about the structure for our queue to function properly?

### Initial notes
1. `.add()` to add something to the queue; `.next()` to get the next from the queue. `.length()` to get the current length of the queue.

2. `.capacity`? the data type of each item in the queue probably. order of items.
