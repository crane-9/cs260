# CS 260: Assignment 6: Binary Search Tree

## BST Tests

Basic insertion test--insert values out-of-order, then print the tree and verify that all is well [how to print BST??]

Basic removal test--after a tree is populated, remove a value. Check again that all is well. Remove another value, check again.
